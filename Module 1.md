# Module 1: Course Overview and Introduction
## 1.2 Introduction to Network Security
### 1.2.1 Computer Security vs Network Security
* **Computer/Information Security:** the collection of tools designed to protect data and thwart hackers
* **Network/Internet Security:** the collection of tools to protect data and communcation between interconnected networks
* ***i*nternet:** (lowercase i) refers to any interconnected *collecton* of networks
* ***I*nternet:** (uppercase I) a *specific example* of internet
    * Network security measures are needed to protect data during transmission
* **Computer Virus:** one of the most publicized types of attacks on information systems; arrive over the internet or from physically on an optical disk loaded into a computer
* Security Violations eg. man-in-the-middle, spoofing, repudiation
### 1.2.2 Definitions and Concepts of Security
* **Computer Security:** "The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)." ([National Insititutes for Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov/))
* **CIA Triad:** the key objectives of Computer/Network Security
1. *Confidentiality:*
    * **Data Confidentiality:** Assures that private/confidential info is not available to unauthorized individuals
    * **Privacy:** Assures that individuals control/influence what info related to them may be collected and stored and by/to whom it may be disclosed to
2. *Integrity:*
    * **Data Integrity:** Assures that info and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner
    * **System Integrity:** Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpared manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system
3. *Availability:*
    * **Availability:** Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users
* **Authenticity:** Verfies that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source
* **Accountability:** Generates the requirement for actions of the entitiy to be traced uniquely to that entity in order to trace a security breach to a responsible party

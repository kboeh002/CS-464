## 1.2 Introduction to Network Security
### 1.2.1 Computer Security vs Network Security
* **Computer/Information Security:** the collection of tools designed to protect data and thwart hackers
* **Network/Internet Security:** the collection of tools to protect data and communcation between interconnected networks
* ***i*nternet:** (lowercase i) refers to any interconnected *collecton* of networks
* ***I*nternet:** (uppercase I) a *specific example* of internet
    * Network security measures are needed to protect data during transmission
* **Computer Virus:** one of the most publicized types of attacks on information systems; arrive over the internet or from physically on an optical disk loaded into a computer
* Security Violations eg. man-in-the-middle, spoofing, repudiation
### 1.2.2 Definitions and Concepts of Security
* **Computer Security:** "The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)." ([National Insititutes for Standards and Technology](http://www.nist.gov/))
* **CIA Triad:** the key objectives of Computer/Network Security
1. *Confidentiality:*
    * **Data Confidentiality:** Assures that private/confidential info is not available to unauthorized individuals
    * **Privacy:** Assures that individuals control/influence what info related to them may be collected and stored and by/to whom it may be disclosed to
2. *Integrity:*
    * **Data Integrity:** Assures that info and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner
    * **System Integrity:** Assures that a system performs its intended function in an unimpared manner, free from deliberate or inadvertent unauthorized manipulation of the system
3. *Availability:*
    * **Availability:** Assures that systems work promptly and service is not denied to authorized users
* **Authenticity:** Verfies that users are who they say they are and that each input arriving at the system came from a trusted source
* **Accountability:** Generates the requirement for actions of the entitiy to be traced uniquely to that entity in order to trace a security breach to a responsible party
### 1.2.3 The OSI Security Architecture
* **International Telecommunication Union-Telecomunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T):** agency sponsored by the United Nations that develops standards
    * they reccomend X.800 Security Architecture for OSI
* **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI):** (model) is a conceptual model that provides a common basis for the coordination of ISO standards of development [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)]; is a framework that describes networking or telecommunications systems in layers [[2](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3239677/the-osi-model-explained-and-how-to-easily-remember-its-7-layers.html)]
* **OSI Network Architecture:** defines a systematic approach for defining the requirements for security of an organization and characterizes the approaches to satisfying those requirements
    * Focuses on security attacks, mechanisms and services:
        * **Security Attack:** any action that compromises the security of information owned by an organization
        * **Security Mechanism:** a process (or device incorperating the process) that is designed to detect, prevent, or recover from a security attack
        * **Security Service:** a processing or communication service that enhances the security of the data processing systems and the information transfers of an organization; intended to counter security attacks making use of $\ge$ 1 security mechanisms
### 1.2.4 Security Attacks
#### Security Attacks
* **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF):** a standards organization for the internet and is responsible for the technical standards that make up the internet [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force)]; defines standard operating internet protocols (eg. TCP, IP) [[4](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/IETF-Internet-Engineering-Task-Force)]
* **Internet Architecture Board (IAB):** "provides long range technical direction for Internet development, ensuring the Internet continues to grow and evolve as a platform and continues to grow and evolve as a platform for global communication and innovation" [[5](https://www.iab.org/)] and strives to...
    * "Ensure that the Internet is a trusted medium of communication that provides a solid technical foundation for privacy and security, especially in light of pervasive surveillance" [[5](https://www.iab.org/)]
    * "Establish the technical direction for an Internet that will enable billions more people to connect, support the vision for an Internet of Things, and allow mobile networks to flourish, while keeping the core capabilities that have been a foundation of the Internetâ€™s success" [[5](https://www.iab.org/)]
    * "Promote the technical evolution of an open Internet without special controls, especially those which hinder trust in the network." [[5](https://www.iab.org/)] 
* **Requests For Comment (RFC):** a formal document from the IETF that contains specifications and organizational notes about topics related to the internet and computer networking (eg. routing, addressing, and transport technologies) [[6](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Request-for-Comments-RFC#:~:text=Robert%20Sheldon-,What%20is%20a%20Request%20for%20Comments%20(RFC)%3F,routing%2C%20addressing%20and%20transport%20technologies.)]
* **Security Attack:** "An assault on a system security that derives from an *intelligent* threat." (definition from RFC no. 2828 from IETF and IAB)
    * **Intelligent Threat:**  an intelligent act that is a deliberate attempt (especially in the sense of a method or technique) to evade security services and to violate the security policy of a system (definition from RFC no. 2828 from IETF and IAB)
    * X.800 and RFC 2828 classify security attacks as either passive or active
#### Passive Attacks
* **Passive Attack:** attempts to learn or make use of information from the system, *but does not affect system resources* (eg. eavesdropping, monitoring transmissions) 
    * are difficult to detect
    * Prevention- encryption rather than worrying about detection
* Types of passive attacks:
    1. **Release of Message Contents:** attacker will monitors an unprotected communications  intercept it for sensitive information (eg.unencrypted email or telephone call) [[7](https://www.venafi.com/blog/what-active-attack-vs-passive-attack-using-encryption#:~:text=Release%20of%20message%20contents%3A%20In,intercept%20it%20for%20sensitive%20information.)]
    2. **Traffic Analysis:** hacker tries to access the same network and listen/capture and analyze your network traffic as it moves to and from the target systems [[8](https://www.netreo.com/blog/traffic-analysis-attack/)] [[9](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-attack#:~:text=Passive%20attacks%20can%20take%20various,communication%20exchanged%20over%20the%20network.)]; use statistical methods to analyze and interpret the patterns of communication exchanged over the network [[9](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/passive-attack#:~:text=Passive%20attacks%20can%20take%20various,communication%20exchanged%20over%20the%20network.)]
        * eg. could observe and determine location/identity of hosts and observe frequency/length of message exchange
#### Active Attacks
* **Active Attack:** Attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation; involves some modification of the data stream or creation of a false stream
* Four types of active attacks:
1. **Masquerade:** when entety pretends to be a different entity; impersonation of entity with those privilages
2. **Replay:** passive capture of a data unit and its subsequent transmission to produce an unauthorized event (eg. taking recording and using it for voice authentication system)
3. **Modification of Messages:** some *portion of a legitamate message* is altered or the message is delayed/reordered to produce an unauthorized effect
    * Prevention- use hashing
4. **Denial of Service (DoS):** prevents the normal use of management of communication facilities; commonly done with DDoS
    * **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** attack that overloads network with messages from numerous computers/machines to flood a targeted resource to degrade its performance [[10](https://www.sunnyvalley.io/docs/network-security-tutorials/dos-vs-ddos-attacks)]
* Prevention - difficult to do absolutely due to variety of physical, software, and network vulnerabilities
* Goal is to detect active attacks and recover from them rather than prevention
### 1.2.5 Security Services
* **Security Service:** a processing or communication service that is provided by a system to give a specific kind of protection to system resources (defined by RFC 2828)
    * impement security policies that are implemented by security mechanisms
* Five types of security services (each defined by X.800):
1. **Authentication:** assurance that the communicating entity is the one that it claims to be
    * **Peer Entity Authentication:** used in association with a logical connection to provide confidence in the identity of the entities connected
    * **Data-Origin Authentication:** in a connectionless transfer provides assurance that the source received data is as claimed
2. **Access Control:** prevention of unauthorized use of resources (eg. chmod, root) ie. ...
    * service controls who have access to the source
    * under what conditions access can occur
    * what those accessing the resource are allowed to do
3. **Data Confidentiality:** the protection of data from unauthorized disclosure
    * **Connection Confidentiality:** the protection of *all* user data *on a connection*
    * **Connectionless Confidentiality:** the protection of *all* user data *in a single data block*
    * **Selective-Field Confidentiality:** the confidentiality of *selected* data fields within the user data *on a connection <u>or</u> a single data block*
    * **Traffic-Flow Confidentiality:** the protection of the information that *might* be derived from *observation* of traffic flows
4. **Data Integrity:** the assurance that data recieved are exactly as sent by an authorized entity
    * **Connection Integrity with Recovery:** provides for the integrity of all user data on a connection and detects any modification, insertion, deletion, or replay of any data within an entire sequence, *with recovery attempted*
    * **Connection Integrity without Recovery:** provides for the integrity of all user data on a connection purely through detection; detects any modification, insertion, deletion, or replay of any data within an entire sequence, *no recovery attempted*
    * **Selective-Field Connection Integrity:** proveds for the integrity of selected fields within the user data of a data block transfered over a connection and takes the form of determination of whether the selected fields have been modified, inserted, deleted, or replayed
    * **Connectionless Integrity:** provides for the integrity of a single connectionless data block and may take the form of detection of data modification; limited form of replay detection *may* be provided
    * **Selective-Field Connectionless Integrity:** provides for the integrity of selected fields within a single connectionless data block; takes the form of determination fo whether or not selected fields have been modified 
5. **Nonrepudiation:** Provides protection against denail by one of the entities involved in a communication of having participated in all or part of the communication
    * **Nonrepudiation, Origin:** proof that the message was sent by the specified party
    * **Nonrepudiation, Destination:** proof that the message was recieved by the specified party
### 1.2.6 Security Mechanisms
*(These are all defined in X.800)*

* **Specific Security Mechanisms:** may be incorporated into the appropriate protocol layer in order to provide some of the OSI security services
    * **Encipherment:** use of mathematical algorithms to transform data into a form that is not readily intelligable; transformation and recovery of data depend on an algorithm of $\ge$ 0 encryption keys
    * **Digital Signature:** data appended to (or a cryptographic transformation of) a data unit that allows a recipient of the data unit to prove the source and integrity of the data unit and protect against forgery
    * **Access Control:** a variety of mechanisms that enforce access rights to resources
    * **Data Integrity:** a variety of mechanisms used to assure the integrity of a data unit or stream of data units
    * **Authentication Exchange:** a mechanism inteded to ensure the identity of an entity by means of information exchange
    * **Traffic Padding:** the insertion of bits into gaps in the data stream to frustrate traffic analysis attempts
    * **Routing Control:** enables selection of particular physically secure routes for certain data and allows reouting changes, especially when a breach of security is suspected
    * **Notarization:** the use of a trusted third party to assure certain properties of a data exchange
* **Pervasive Security Mechanisms:** Mechanisms that are not specific to any particular OSI security service or protocol layer
    * **Trusted Functionality:** that which is percieved ot be correct with respect to some criteria (eg. established by a security policy)
    * **Security Label:** the marketing bound to a resource which may be a data unit that names or designates the security attributes of that resource
    * **Event Detection:** detection of security-relevant events
    * **Security Audit Trail:** data collected and potentially used to facilitate a security audit
        * **Security Audit:** an independent review and examination of system records and activities
    * **Security Recovery:** deals with the requests from mechanisms (eg. event handling and management functions) and takes recovery actions
